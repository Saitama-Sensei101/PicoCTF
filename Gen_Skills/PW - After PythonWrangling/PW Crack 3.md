# Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/17/level3.py) and you'll need the encrypted [flag](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/17/level3.flag.txt.enc) and the [hash](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/17/level3.hash.bin) in the same directory too. There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

# Commands used
#linux_commands  **[[LINUX COMMANDS]]**
1. wget - to download the files `wget [dwnld_lnk_adrs]`
2. python - to run the python script.

# Steps
Once again, just like the previous challenge [[PW Crack 2]], you have 2 options/methods or maybe more to solve this. I tried in 2 different methods.

If you read the code, specially the section which says `7 possible passwords`! You have 2 type of thoughts in head! 

**Method 1 - The Boring**
Test each password manually! That's it, and eventually you'll get the flag in one of the flags!

**Method 2 - Little less boring**
Write a script or prompt any AI to write you a script to automate this password testing process. And there you have it! The flag!

If I sound unenthusiastic, I have had a very long day by this point, so... whatever!

Next one --> [[PW Crack 4]].
