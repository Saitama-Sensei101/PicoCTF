### Description
Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `abcba9f7`
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

This challenge brings forth the Linux basics & fundamentals. Changing directories and using *cat* command mostly. nothing much of a difficulty for this one.

### Commands used 
#linux_commands [[LINUX COMMANDS]]
- ssh - its a cryptographic protocol, to connect to remote servers.
- cd - SERIOUSLY!
- cat - HAVE A FEAR OF LORD

### Steps
1. There is nothing much practically to do, just *ssh* to the link provided after launching the instance. Basically run this

		ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 51412
2. Yours might differ but this is what is given once the instance is launched.
3. Rest is pretty much *cat* and *cd* and look into every text file that can be seen.
`[ AFTER EVERY *cd* USE *ls* COMMAND TO SEE WHAT IS IN THE DIRECTORY TO NOT MISS OUT ANY FILE. ]`
